Building the source
===================

Use the Makefile. It assumes libSOIL.a and SOIL.h are in the
same directory as the application - be better to put them
in a separate directory.

If doing this on a machine without the SOIL library then 
download the SOIL source and compile it: http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html.
Then copy the static library, i.e. libSOIL.a to the current directory
along with SOIL.h
